min_sigma : scalar or sequence of scalars, optional

the minimum standard deviation for Gaussian kernel. 
Keep this low to detect smaller blobs. The standard 
deviations of the Gaussian filter are given for each 
axis as a sequence, or as a single number, in which 
case it is equal for all axes.

max_sigma : scalar or sequence of scalars, optional

The maximum standard deviation for Gaussian kernel. 
Keep this high to detect larger blobs. The standard 
deviations of the Gaussian filter are given for each 
axis as a sequence, or as a single number, in which 
case it is equal for all axes.

num_sigma : int, optional

The number of intermediate values of standard 
deviations to consider between min_sigma and 
max_sigma.
_____________________________________________________

threshold : float, optional.

The absolute lower bound for scale space maxima. 
Local maxima smaller than thresh are ignored. Reduce 
this to detect blobs with less intensities.
_____________________________________________________

overlapfloat, optional

A value between 0 and 1. If the area of two blobs 
overlaps by a fraction greater than threshold, the 
smaller blob is eliminated.

log_scale : bool, optional
If set intermediate values of standard deviations 
are interpolated using a logarithmic scale to the 
base 10. If not, linear interpolation is used.

exclude_border : tuple of ints, int, or False, optional

If tuple of ints, the length of the tuple must match 
the input arrayâ€™s dimensionality. Each element of the 
tuple will exclude peaks from within exclude_border-
pixels of the border of the image along that 
dimension. If nonzero int, exclude_border excludes 
peaks from within exclude_border-pixels of the border 
of the image. If zero or False, peaks are identified 
regardless of their distance from the border
